# Malaysia COVID data loader

This repo stores the source code for a rudimentary AWS Chalice app that loads data for COVID19 cases in Malaysia. It reads from [this fantastic Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15A43eb68LT7gg_k9VavYwS1R2KkCTpvigYMn5KT9RTM/) that contains up-to-date information on the COVID19 pandemic in Malaysia, updated after daily press conferences by the Ministry of Health.

Big thanks to Erhan Azrai (@ErhanAzrai) and Lok Chen Yue (@PentLok), for putting this data together and making it available to all!

## How to deploy

Would like to share my link, but I would prefer to keep my AWS usage low. Strip the functions from `app.py` for your own use, or deploy this yourself (and potentially learn a new skill :) ):

1. Install AWS Chalice with `pip install chalice`
2. You'll need an AWS account, free tier is more than enough. 
3. Setup your AWS credentials [https://github.com/aws/chalice#credentials](https://github.com/aws/chalice#credentials), 
4. Run `chalice new-project YOUR-PROJECT-NAME-HERE` to initialize, then replace the default `app.py` and `requirements.txt` with those in this repo.
5. Run `chalice deploy` from within the project folder. Deploying will take a while as `pandas` has a few too many dependencies, especially in the context of a serverless application.
6. When done, Chalice will show your Rest API URL.

## Usage

``` python
import pandas as pd
URL="YOUR-AWS-LAMBDA-API"

# Latest reported cases, nationwide
nat = df.read_json(URL + 'latest/national')

# nat.tail()
